{-
Provides an indication whether the given jug values can produce desired value.
@param  x    the capacity, in gallons, of the first jug of water
        y    the capacity, in gallons, of the second jug of water
        z    the desired amount of gallons
@return Bool Whether solution for BÃ©zout's identity for given inputs exists,
             ax + by = z
