HOW TO DO TESTING?
(Note: we assume that you implement different functions in different files)

1. mkSet
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestHelper.hs TestMkSet.hs"

2. subset
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestSubset.hs"

3. setEqual
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestSetEqual.hs"

4. setProd
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestHelper.hs TestSetProd.hs"

5. partitionSet
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestHelper.hs TestPartitionSet.hs"

6. bellNum
   After load your own .hs file, you need append test files with command
   ":a TestBellNum.hs"
