To run the Main component for Animals (supporting command-line arguments):
    1.) Compile Main
        > javac Main.java
    2.) Run with proper argument formation (no support for malformed arguments), example:
        > java Main "d Adam" "d Bob" "d Carmy" "c Daisy"

To run the Main component for Shapes:
    1.) Compile Main
        > javac Main.java
    2.) Run with proper argument formation (again, no support for malformed arguments), example:
        > java Main "c 1.0 0.2 4.4" "t 0.4 5.3 1.0 3.9 4.0 2.0" "r 3.0 -3.4 2.3 0.0" "c 0 0 10."
