   Java Generics ...

   Some examples:

      TypeUnSafe00.java
      TypeSafe00.java
      TypeSafe01.java
      CoAndContraEx.java

   Note that this file:
      evalExpr02.hs
   is only an example of the parts that an interpreter system for a
   small language contains.

   1) The tokenizer is what is also called a lexer
   2) The parser takes the tokens from the tokenizer and translates it
      into a parse tree
   3) The eval function takes the parse tree and evaluates/interprets
      the tree
